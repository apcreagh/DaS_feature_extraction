  <b>Figure -</b>
  <em>Demonstration of the Floodlight PoC "Draw a Shape" test performed by a healthy participant using a smartphone. Each participant was instructed to draw six different shapes presented on the smartphone screen as fast and as accurate as possible, within a maximum time of 30 seconds per each attempted shape: a diagonal line bottom left to top right and a diagonal line top right to bottom left (not depicted), a square, a circle, afigure-8-shape, and a spiral.</em>

## The Draw a Shape Assesment
 The Floodlight Proof-of-Concept (PoC) app was designed to remotely measure, at home in an unsupervised setting, functional ability in people with with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). The study “Monitoring of Multiple Sclerosis Participants With the Use of Digital Technology (Smartphones and Smartwatches)—A Feasibility Study” (NCT02952911) was the first clinical trial to implement the Floodlight PoC app. <br>
The Draw a Shape Test required participants to draw six prewritten shapes of increasing complexity (two diagonal lines, a square, circle, a figure-of-8, and a spiral), in order to assess fine finger or manual dexterity. For more information on the Floodlight PoC app, please see [2].

The codebase demonstrates how to perform modular, scalable and parallelizable draw a shape feature extraction from smartphone touch screen sensor data. 
# Draw a Shape Feature Extraction Codebase
## Dependencies 
- MATLAB R2020b (v9.9)                              
- Signal Processing Toolbox (v8.5)             
- Image Processing Toolbox (v11.2)             
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (v12.0)
- Wavelet Toolbox (v5.5)      

## Running the Code
See **`example.m`** for a tutorial on how to implement use this feature extraction code. Briefly, running the **`featureExtraction.m`** function will extract features across various domains, which can be loosely grouped into (1) temporal, (2) spatial, and (3) spatio-temporal feature domains. 
```matlab
%%---------------Feature Extraction----------------------%
%shapeData: a cell containing the shape data and information. 
%shape: (string) shape name, e.g. 'SPIRAL"
%extra_options: structure containing optional inputs to be used in each feature extraction function.
[features, feature_names] = featureExtraction(shapeData, shape, extra_options);
```
# Feature Extraction Examples
Multiple features were extracted from each shape capturing temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal aspects involved in the drawing task and potentially respective of manual dexterity. Some visual examples of features are demonstrated in the figures below. For more information on the features, see our papwer [1] as well as other excellent references for features which we adapted in our work [3-6]. 

## Temporal Feature Example(s)

  <b>Figure -</b> <em> Example illustrations of circle shape drawn by (L-R): healthy control (HC) PwMS (no apparent upper extremity dysfunction), and aPwMS (abnormal upper extremity function) subjects. Red points depict actual pixel points drawn relative to interpolated reference coordinates (black). The top row demonstrates examples of drawing speed for duration of time to draw each respective shape. Time series speed signal was firstfiltered using a low pass filter with a cut off frequency of 8 Hz. The bottom row represents the power spectral density (PSD) estimate of drawing speed which was computed using a Hamming window. Note
the time and PSD axis scale between the figures. </em>

## Spatial Feature Example(s)

  <img src="./img/fig3c.png" width="32%" alt>
  <b>Figure -</b> <em> Examples of figure-8-shapes drawn by (L-R): healthy control (HC) PwMS (no apparent upper extremity dysfunction), and aPwMS (abnormal upper extremity function) subjects. Figure depicts actual pixel points drawn (blue) relative to interpolated reference coordinates (black). Hausdorff Distance query points are illustrated with red lines and maximal Hausdorff Distances (HausD, as measured in Pixels) are highlighted with black circles; HC (64 Pixels) , nPwMS (90 Pixels), aPwMS (229 Pixels). The total drawing error (HausDError) can also be defied as sum of the Hausdorff distances (i.e. the largest minimum
distances) between the drawn and reference shape, normalized by the number of touch coordinates drawn. </em>

## Spatialtemporal Feature Example(s)

  <img src="./img/fig4c.png" width="32%" alt>
  <b>Figure -</b> <em>  Pixel density heat map representation of spiral shapes drawn (L-R): healthy control (HC) PwMS (no apparent upper extremity dysfunction), and aPwMS (abnormal upper extremity function) subjects. Screen coordinates are first segmented into 2D bins of xed width and drawing touch point coordinates are assigned to respective bins. The number of touch coordinates per bin, and hence time, are represented by heat map colour. This builds a spatio-temporal representation of digital spiral drawing which encode areas of drawing hesitation or non-movements. </em>
